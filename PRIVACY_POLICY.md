If you choose not to read this entire Privacy Policy, we want you to review some key points about AvaSwap privacy practices:

Apps are photo or video editors that allow users to edit portraits with highly realistic facial transformations.
We do not use the photos or videos you provide when you use the App for any reason other than to provide you with the editing functionality of the App.
We use third-party cloud providers — specifically Google Cloud Platform and Amazon Web Services — to process and edit photos and videos.
You only send to the cloud the photos or videos you specifically choose to edit.
Photos or videos are temporarily stored on a cloud server during editing and encrypted with a key stored locally on your mobile device.
The photo or video will be deleted immediately after finishing the editing process.

Here's more information about our privacy practices.

1. INFORMATION WE COLLECT

  When you use the App and select photos or videos to edit, we cache them for processing to provide the requested editing service:

  Photos or videos you select when using the App, via your camera or photo gallery (if you have given the App access to your camera or photo gallery) or via the internet search function in Application. We only process specific photos and videos that you choose to modify using the App; and we don't collect your photo albums or videos even if you give us access to them. We protect each photo or video you choose with an encryption key stored locally on your device. This means that the only device that can view the photo or video is the device to which the photo or video is sent using the App – the user's device. We take steps to remove any metadata that may be associated with photos or videos you provide while using the App. Photos or videos will be cached and will be deleted as soon as the editing process is finished. The results will only be saved to your device memory if you want them to.

2. HOW WE USE YOUR INFORMATION

  We do not use photographs or videos you provide when you use the Apps for any reason other than to provide you with the editing functionality of the Apps.

3. HOW WE SHARE YOUR INFORMATION

  We do not disclose user photographs or videos to third parties (with the exception of temporarily caching an encrypted version with our cloud providers, Google Cloud Platform and Amazon Web Services, to provide the photo and video editing features of the Apps). We cannot share the photos and videos cached for processing as we do not store the encryption keys.
